# Image-Classification-using-TensorFlow-CIFAR-10-Data
This project implements an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images to classify them into different categories. It uses deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to achieve accurate predictions.
