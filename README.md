# Image Classification using TensorFlow

# ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project implements an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images to classify them into different categories. It uses deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to achieve accurate predictions.

# ðŸš€ Features

Uses TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning.

Trains a CNN model on a labeled dataset.

Supports custom datasets for flexible training.

Visualizes training progress using Matplotlib.

Evaluates model performance with accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

Loads and predicts new images after training.

# ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
